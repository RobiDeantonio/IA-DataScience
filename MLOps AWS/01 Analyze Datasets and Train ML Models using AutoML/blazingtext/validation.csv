__label__0 "bought it on sale and i am keeping it . it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality . however i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant . still i am keeping it to use on those days i just do n't feel like dressing up for work . i bought a large ( i 'm a 36-38c ) but i think i could 've gotten away with a medium ."
__label__1 "i saw this dress on someone and knew immediately i had to have it . it is stunning in person ."
__label__-1 "i love the pattern adn color combo but wow t really flatering on me . too much fabric . i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu . anyway not for me but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me ... too bad . length was decent in regulat size though not too long . just too wide ."
__label__0 "not flattering if your have large top . made well and very cute for thin no boob person"
__label__1 "this vest kept catching my eye online . i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater ( which is fabulous ) when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest & sweater . the more i looked at these pictures the more i fell in love with the vest . needless to say i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts . it 's incredibly soft & a great piece to add to your wardrobe !"
__label__-1 "it 's a cute idea but it 's so low cut and the material is very thin . i was hoping to wear it as a cool flowing summer top but i 'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it . i 'm only keeping it because it was such a good price . also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten ."
__label__-1 "super itchy ! had to return ."

__label__1 "very nice top fits true to size a little short buy looks nice with jeans or work pants"
__label__0 "this fit well but the top was very see through . this never would have worked for me . i 'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and did n't order it online . with different fabric it would have been great ."
__label__1 "i love this shirt for its subdued colors and casual style . it is lighter in weight than a flannel shirt but retains a feeling of softness . it is from cloth and stone a brand i like . usually i buy that brand in a small because their shirts run large for me . i liked this shirt so much i ordered it twice and waited for a backorder . i sent the small size back and was lucky enough to get a medium before the next out of stock situation ."

__label__1 "my preference is clothing made of natural fibers but i could n't resist trying this on once i felt it ! the cut-out pattern in the fabric the color the buttons & the design of the back all add to make a dress i 'm going to wear with leather flip-flops during the day or wedges & a denim jacket at night . it 's perfect for southern california fall ( & likely much of winter this year ) weather . i 'm a 32d ( & wo n't need/wear a bra ) & although i usually wear a 6 i bought a 4. maeve i like your style !"
__label__-1 "saw this on line and decided to splurge for the holidays . arrived today and is going right back . runs very small especially in the waist . trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper . fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture appears cheap and very itchy . sooooo disappointed ."
__label__-1 "this sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life but the inside is so scratchy . i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper . unlined and uncomfortable . no thank you ! should you choose to proceed i found the fit tts . i 'm 5 ' 8 wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me ."
__label__0 "i really really wanted to love this jacket . unfortunately i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me . it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer . i am 5 ' 6 but long waisted . this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature . it was beautiful ( although the buttons were cheap ... )"
__label__0 "i loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store particularly the muted red color . the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me . however part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired . since i purchased during the sale i 'm going to try and mend myself but this may end up having to go back . if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged i would recommend it !"
__label__-1 "this product was very disappointing . fabric was thin it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top . so it 's not flattering at all . at $ 78 it 's really overpriced for what it is . it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape ( what would n't ? ) but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs . i 'm 5 ' 9 and not well-endowed ( a b ) so it did nothing for me .. also the online picture of the moss version looks like it 's a grey/black combo . it 's not ... it is really green"

__label__0 "i really love this top but am afraid i may need to return it because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it and they show really badly as black spots because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads . it feels so good on though ! you must be super careful with it . i have no idea how the little snags even got there !"
__label__1 "this is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made ! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter . i am 5 ' 9 a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect ! buy this now ! !"

__label__1 "this top is simple but beautiful . i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl . it is a swing top but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing . i am around 5 ' 6 and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all . i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks . the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like . a great staple for your closet ."
__label__-1 "runs small . i 'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing ( for reference i 'm 5 ' 4 129lbs 36b ) . the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist . i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large . pretty vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes ."
__label__1 "i bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer . store but they didn & # 39 ; t have my size . someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up . i probably would have bought the xs but it was gone . i went with it a little oversized and love it ! great quality and workmanship on the embroidery . more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005 ! super cute love it !"

__label__-1 "the design is very flattering and holiday appropriate . but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used . although figure flattering the zipper is so cheap that -- it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress . and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they 're asking for it . maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail"

__label__1 "i ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you 're well endowed . it 's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs . have n't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized ( but cozy ) and it 's really long . it almost touches the top of my knees in back . sooooo pretty though ."
__label__-1 "there were just too many pleats to this thing . it was not flattering . it looks fantastic on this model but not on me . oh well ."
__label__-1 "i love the material on these shorts . unfortunately that 's all i love . the fit is awkward and i 'm an easy fit . they 're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well . sadly could n't keep these just for the pretty fabric ."

__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 2-5 ' 3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer ( former employee ) and while the bodice hit right the skirt was insanely long . not even with heels is this gon na be right . and no discount towards hemming ? i 'll wait until this hits the sale rack which it will because concensus is it 's way too long ."
__label__-1 "this skirt is very pretty but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized so there 's very little stretch . for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements there 's no way to get this skirt on past the hips ."
__label__0 "i really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy . i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same boxy but shorter so i decided to pass ."
__label__-1 "this may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried . the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo absolutely garish . the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties it just looks cheap . the skirt is an antebellum nightmare . i did not even want to try it on it 's that bad . i considered adding a photo but was too horrified . for reference i 'm 5'10 approximately the height/ size of the model but it was shorter than the photo depictes . i wanted to like it"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model but unfortunately for me it did n't fit right . i 'm petite and ordered the xxs petite . it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress . the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color . it just did n't fit right . definitely looks great on the model but hung funny on me . i can see why it was highly rated gorgeous dress - just not on me ."

__label__1 "dress is comfortable feels great and the fit exceeds flattery . the length hits just above my knees and the small side triangle cutouts add a unique cute fun but still classic detail that i did n't notice in the picture online . i love this dress and get so many compliments ."

__label__1 "this dress just feels and looks amazing . i love how it is n't too short like a lot of new styles . i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter . i also love the plaid cuff detail . the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced . i got home and realized one button was missing . i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms 2 buttons popped off !"

__label__0 "this top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price . it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it . also the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt . still the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans ."
__label__1 "so simple to throw on with jeans or you could dress it up . the ruffles give it a little extra flair . nice and soft really comfy . i have n't decided which size i am going to hold onto . i ordered in a small and a medium . small fits me great and i am usually a pretty standard medium . i think it just depends on what look you are going for . wish they had it in a lighter color like an ivory or pink . i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade ."
__label__1 "i received so many compliments on these pants ! these are not only classic they fit amazing ... look great with heels and/or booties . match both black and brown ."

__label__0 "i liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple ; however i feel that it was overpriced for the quality . it 's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale ."
__label__-1 "i was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much . sadly no . first of all they run small . i am between a s and xs in most brands bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side . these felt a little snug and short but i decided to keep them . the first time i washed them they were ruined . i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer plus a delicate cycle no dryer . the lace is man"
__label__0 "for reference i 'm 113 lbs with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line . i was expecting a soft comfortable and polished piece . i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line it 's a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast . also it is a mixed-media/material type . for example it 's linen with soft leather accents which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar on the wrist area"
__label__0 "absolutely stinning dress ! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper ... one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress . sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky .. i am on the fence about whether or not it 's a keeper ... definitely perfect for the smaller chested . i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would 've smashed . neverth"
__label__0 "this dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much . i am 5 ' 1.5 and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing . the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers . there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me . i hope to try this in a 4p ."
__label__-1 "the overall styling was great and the dress is super-cute if a little thick ( it 's made of denim after all ) . i ordered a size down from my normal and even then i was swimming in it . the worst part and the aspect that will make me return it is that the arm holes hang down so low that i 'd have to wear a tank top under the dress . i 'm returning it though it is really cute and i love this brand . the arm holes killed it for me ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me . i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places . but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly . well i sized down and ordered a small and it just did n't work . it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump . overall its cute just not for me ."
__label__-1 "the turqoise color is pretty however it did smell bad out of the package . i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants bra and cami ! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub ."
__label__-1 "this skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away . i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on but was disappointed by the awkward ruching . if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband ( thereby also shortening it to knee length ) it would have been lovely . it should be noted that this is midi-length which is awkward on me . i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely ."

__label__-1 "i ordered this in size xl in ivory . it was a drab poorly-made too-small sweater . the knit material was n't good quality and the overall fit did n't work . i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock then i would have overlooked the problems . but there are better ivory retailer cardigans available . this was returned ."

__label__0 "this shirt runs extremely large . looks boxy and unflattering ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewers that this runs big . unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back . i love the lyocell material i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it does n't look right . it is not as pictured as well . the skirt i received is a medium blue denim not the lovely light blue as pictured another reason why i am returning ."
__label__1 "love the length color and rise . new favorite jeans ! they 're a little loose around the ankle and the way they hang is the only thing i do n't like ."

__label__1 "this top is full of amazing details . the photos really do n't do it justice . it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue . i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5 ' 5 frame but because of the detailing ... it just works ."

__label__-1 "i was so excited for this dress to arrive but when it did it was a major disappointment . there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer . also the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way . the colors were beautiful but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws . i am 5 ' 6 140lb and the small fit tts . will be sending it back"
__label__0 "ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture . the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear . makes you look wider than you are ! pocket on front are also large which accentuate thighs . these were returned immediately as it did not work for me ."
__label__0 "frustrated that the details do n't mention there 's a side zip . for whatever reason i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it 's a pull-on style when that 's not the case . there 's also no give in the waist . besides the fit not working for me it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on ."
__label__0 "i love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work . welp that 's out the window . this design is poor . for one this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i do n't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his . this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso . so without a jacket i would never wear this . it 's very low cut .. the back is very low .. it 's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4 ."

__label__1 "this sweater is beautiful but is definitely more for looks than warmth . it 's very soft but very thin . i prefer the way it looks open rather than buttoned . i got the moss green color on sale and i am glad i did n't pay full price for it -- it 's lovely but certainly not worth $ 88 ."
__label__1 "i was looking for a top to go with leggings that did n't look like a sack and this is perfect . the v-neck and unusual cut on the bottom makes it more interesting than a typical tunic and the fabric is so snuggly . love it ."
__label__1 "another maeve maxi to add to my crowded closet ! i adore the print it reminds me of morocco . i went with my usual m based on reviews about the waistband . i will have to disagree as i should have chosen s instead . i 'm not going to return it but i think this will really stretch out because of the knit and weight of the jersey ."
__label__1 "this dress is a great casual outfit . tha fabric is substantial and very soft . the only negative would be it is a little large through the chest/arms . i ordered a large as i am curvy but would like to exchange for a medium . sadly the medium is sold out but i love the dress so much i am keeping it !"
__label__0 "i really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great . however the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy . i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft not my 5 ' 6 self ."

__label__1 "in the quest to find comfy cute casual tops i took a change on this one . it 's cute but quite oversized . it just overwhelmed me . i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model . the style and color just did n't suit my coloring or body type but i still recommend because it 's comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else 's closet ."
__label__0 "finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style . my size l tights were just that -- tight ! so tight i really did n't want to pull them up past the knee ! ! i am not kidding . i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely so there was no reason to expect a l would n't fit . so sad ."

__label__0 "i was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful . the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer . then i tried it on .... to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely . it was a total joke . this dress is for very small chested only ."

__label__-1 "wanted to love this top and could imagine lots of outfits with it . the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big . the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place accentuating my belly . it did arrive very wrinkled although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment . maybe that made the look worse . overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am so back it goes . i am 5 ' 7 160lbs 34dddd and the size large was the correct size ."
__label__1 "very cute plaid button down that is tts ; i am busty and the l fit just right with enough room without the buttons doing the splits like most shirts . the dainty details & material of this button down makes this stand out from other button downs that look like flannels -- which this is not . it is woven of a fine material enough to be able to wear a camisole underneath it is not a flannel shirt . colors are vibrant and the purple in the back really is quite attractive . happy i got this on sale & sale"
__label__0 "i was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model ! however when i put the dress on there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton . i ordered the 0p and i am 5 ' 4 110lbs . maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top ."

__label__-1 "i ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite one 00. the style color and cut are all perfect . one not so minor downfall however . the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot both during the first time just trying them on . i ca n't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed . very sad about this ."
__label__-1 "too small ... too flare ... nice thick fabric . not my favorite pant ."
__label__-1 "i am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me . sleeves were especially long ."
__label__-1 "the picture makes the shorts look structured . i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material . i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester . also this runs way too big . i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs . i would n't even buy this at the sale price ."
__label__1 "i love this sweater it 's so soft and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it . it runs true to size but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more it seems to stretch a little . overall i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it !"
__label__-1 "i am returning the dress . it has too much volume and is not flattering at all"
__label__-1 "i agree with the other review . the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made . the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality ; however the shirt is very wide . i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big . the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance ."
__label__1 "i really love this shirt . the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style . i thought the fit was perfect - i 'm 5 ' 5 120lbs and i ordered an xs . still enough room to be comfortable . super cute ! glad i bought it ."

__label__1 "i love this fabric it is comfortable and forgiving . as i prefer jewel tone colors the sapphire is great . i wish it would be offered in red like the cowl neck long sleeve tee . with that said i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd and while i wish it were a few inches longer ( 3/4 sleeved ) . the only reason i have n't given it five stars is that i have n't laundered it enough to verify the quality ."
__label__-1 "i tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 ( a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea ) . the 4 fit in the outer layer however as the previous poster mentioned the lining is super tight . i could n't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips . the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining . not sure what when wrong here but it 's a shame because it 's a really cute dress ."

__label__1 "this t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything . my only concern is the fabric is super light . not enough to be see through but just enough to make me question the quality . i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though . the drape is nice and not super revealing ; discreet enough for work . i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile ."
__label__-1 "had to return this for a couple of reasons : 1 ) was too small ! it 's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand . i did n't bother to order a size up because i was n't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large . 2 ) the main color is n't grey like the picture . it 's a black and white checkered pattern . so it does n't look at all grey irl . i 'm still recommending because if you get the right size and like the colors it will be a nice light and comfy swea"

__label__-1 "i 'm 5'-4 130lbs with a 32f chest . this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu . i ca n't imagine this looking good on anyone who is n't 7 ' tall . also the straight across rather high neck line was n't flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge . the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap . it was n't see through but it had the feel of a nightgown not a hundred dollar dress ."
__label__-1 "it 's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore ."
__label__0 "i love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it . i would have realized the front and back are different materials which i am not a fan of . i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back . it 's like a mullet business in the front and party in the back . it 's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though so into rotation it goes ."
__label__0 "comfortable and soft material cute design and nice longer length .. however i 'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist . would be cute for someone shorter ."

__label__-1 "this tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole . first of all the armhole is way too low ! second there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm . since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem . no need for the side zipper it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side ."
__label__1 "this top is very well made . nice heavy material for those in between days . the back is slightly longer than the front and it is well finished inside . i ordered a 00 which fits great in the body area but a little tight on my arms . still a keeper !"

__label__0 "the way the back came down so much made the top look weird . i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much . also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture . so to me it was just a over priced odd top ."

__label__-1 "i have to agree with the first reviewer ! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i could n't justify it for the price . i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well but just could n't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes ! i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews"

__label__1 "okay this is the cutest sleep jumper i 've ever owned . it 's soft and cozy and even a tiny bit sexy . i give it 4 stars because it 's a little on the thin side ; not sheer but close . really fun little piece . definitely recommend ."
__label__1 "i recently bought this blouse the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful . love it !"
__label__-1 "i second that above review who states worst blouse i 've ever ordered"
__label__1 "this shirt fits really well- i ordered a size small and it 's definitely a bit form fitting . i was a little bit hesitant to purchase this at first- for a tshirt it 's a pretty hefty price . but the quality and cut are really quite attractive and worth every penny ."
__label__0 "as another reviewer mentioned the quality is n't here . they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly . such a bummer because i love this brand ."
__label__0 "i have a few pairs of the stevie ankle so i thought i try these . they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist . the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent ... like white stripes . they make the jean look overall cheap . not worth $ 198 in my opinion ."
__label__0 "loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors . love the luxurious feel of the silky flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways . however after washing per instructions the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah pilled mess that gathers at the seams ( especially the bottom seam ) . tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing . looks like a cheap lackluster layering top now and definitely wo n't last another season . so disappointed - if you ca"
__label__-1 "i 'm usually a fan of maeve but this dress is just bad . the fabric is thin and filmy and it stretches to sheer over your chest . the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose it just droops in a most unfortunate way ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these in m ( 5 ' 8 140 lbs . ) and they are tts : they fit well and are neither tight nor loose . the issue that i have with them ( and the reason that i sent them back ) is that the material although comfortable is completely transparent ; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless ! furthermore these are not white but off-white ( and quite a yellowy off-white at that ) so these loungers do n't look as cute with the feature"

__label__1 "i wish it was a little bigger.i kept this for it will be wonderful for summer ."
__label__0 "i like my clothes loose fitting but even for me this ran large i am 5 ' 7 134b and medium fit in the shoulders but was too big overall"
__label__1 "i ordered top and pants online as seen . pants are of good quality and hang beautiful . i love the color and quality of the fabric . nice and vibrant . nice fit at the top into a flowy drape . the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size . love the outfit for my upcoming island trip ."
__label__0 "the fabric feel and design of this dress is sooo cute but so large that sadly it will need to go back . beautiful and softly flowing design but so full that not flattering ."
__label__1 "the print and fit of this dress is perfect ! it 's very flattering and slimming ."
__label__-1 "i was so bummed when this came in ... the colors and print are beautiful but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo . there is also a liner which is a nice touch but it 's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts . definitely going back ."
__label__-1 "as soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it ! unfortunately it just did n't work for me i tried it in a small medium and large . for reference i 'm 5 ' 2 145lbs 36d . the dress is really pretty in person but i looked like a little girl in it . my daughter who is 4 ' 9 100lbs 34a also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it . the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline however the neckline is not open like in the picture it 's more pushed toget"
__label__0 "i read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it . first the good : i love the color the fabric and the design . it 's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days . the neck and sleeves are pretty on . i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things . now the bad : it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package ! im surprised a"

__label__0 "i bought these pants in white and tan . they are comfortable and fit great.however they tend to stretch . i just got them and they are already starting to become uncomfortably loose . i still really like them but i recommend you buy a little tight so they become comfortable ."
__label__0 "i love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark . the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf . i think they make the leg look stunted . the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw . it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed ."
__label__-1 "fun sexy underwear but rides up in the front . will return"
__label__1 "i bought this blouse after i saw my aunt wearing it . the color is lovely . i spilled soup on it during my first wearing and it laundered wonderfully . i am so glad ! such an easy piece to throw on very comfortable . fit is great ."
__label__0 "the shirt design is very nice but it fits very loose . it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit . the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight . the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material ."
__label__0 "what a huge disappointment ! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust . if you have any semblance of a chest this is not for you ! i am a 38c and this was a no go . the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no . it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms ."
__label__-1 "disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $ 128 they are asking i would be a tad skewed . not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling . does n't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer . i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again . big loser ."
__label__1 "i really like this top . bought it in purple but i would not call it that . it is more maroon or burgundy . color is exactly what it shows in the online photo . really like the green also . crocheted arms are super . i found it ran slightly small so if you are between sizes order up . one slight personal problem for me is that there is cashmere in it and i live in florida . even though we do get cooler weather here i am not sure i will have that much chance to wear it ; it will be too warm for me . t"
__label__-1 "i was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern . however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness . the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top . i wanted to keep this but h"

__label__-1 "this has such awful proportions . i 'm 5 ' 0 and 100 lbs ordered xxs petite ( in the neutral color ) . the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust ! ! it looks very unflattering and it 's very pronounced . i 'm only 5 ' 0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me . below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it 's sewed and it balloons outward and is very square from there down . very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi"
__label__0 "i saw this top on sale and tried it on right away . my normal medium was too big so i purchased the small in the rose color . wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans . wow what an outfit ! ! ! ! then i washed it according to directions and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank . i was so disappointed . i wished i had read the reviews beforehand ."
__label__1 "absolutely love this dress ! i ended up wearing it backwards to work for a more modest neckline but flipped it around for an evening night out . ca n't recommend it enough - two of my colleagues ordered it that day ."
__label__1 "i saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream . i have worn it every chance i get . it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans . the length is perfect the design is flattering and the material is soft and comfortable . the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse . this will be a go to item . thanks retailer- another gem !"
__label__-1 "i do n't normally write reviews but this shirt was so terrible that i felt inspired . first off the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo . secondly there is no shape whatsoever unlike in the photo . it bells out like a tent . it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not . overall this shirt is an insult to the female form . retailer what is with all of these shapeless frocks in cheap f"

__label__0 "i tried this dress on in the store prepared to buy this lovely piece . i feel that it should have been a few inches longer it would look more proportionate . next the tie is really difficult to place but it creates some great detail to the front and back . it wrinkles easily i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear . lastly it is not lined what a bummer at least the skirt could be lined . but it does have pockets that is sweet ."
__label__1 "super cute and simple shirt ( as other reviewer said lol ) . but she was right ! i have another shirt from this brand and it 's one of my favorites . it runs true to size . it 's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall . it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i 'm only 5 ' 2 and i would n't want it to be any shorter ."
__label__0 "i stopped into a store near me specifically to try these on given how adorable they look here . while i liked them i did n't love them . i love some stretch so that part was good . however the denim was much thinner and lighter colored than they look to me online here . i really want to love them though their light color has me less enthusiastic . another reviewer also mentioned a butt-flattening effect which i noticed also . i might have sprung for them anyway they do have a cute shape bu"

__label__1 "this is my favorite shirt to wear around the house . it 's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice i 'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood . the fabric is thin but is n't too delicate and it 's not sheer which makes it a great summer lounge shirt . the cut is flattering and the back does n't show my bra which too many of this design do . it is a bit large you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious ."
__label__-1 "i did not like this cashmere sweater at all . i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color . although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40 % off ."

__label__0 "i ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed . as other reviewers have mentioned the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures . the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person . as for sizing i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers ' comments about it running small . the 2p fit me fine although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested # 32b # . i can definitely see that being an issue"

__label__0 "this may be lovely on some people but it did n't work on me at all . i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight . if i had gone up a size the top would have been huge . the bib was n't flattering on me and it 's also quite sheer . too bad because the print is great . maybe if you 're athletic with slim hips you can manage it . i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you . back it went sadly ."

__label__0 "o.k . i soo wanted to love this dress . if you are slim and small chested it is true to size and lovely . i am slim and tall 5 ' 9 but am large chested . a 36d i usually wear an 8/10 so bought a 10. it was too tight around my chest and back . so i went up a size to a 12. it was better but not exactly comfortable . i could get away with it but for the price had to send it back . the idea of going up another size yet again was a thought but i worried it would n't solve my issue ."
__label__-1 "i was expecting a lot more but this was disappointing . the material is thin and the quality is n't great . it also hung loose just too loose as it runs very very large i returned it"
__label__0 "i followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe . i am usually a size 8 but ordered a 12 ( ok maybe overkill ) . i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight but this was way too big and tent like . i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size . stay tuned for an update !"
__label__0 "these were a little baggier than expected and the petite size ran long ."
__label__0 "i really like the color and flow of this dress . the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust . i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses . unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip ."
__label__1 "this is just a fantastic dress ! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove . i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps : ) i took the regular length and found it perfect . the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower . i 'm only 51 but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me definitely a keeper !"
__label__1 "i had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited ! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body . i love the bottom of it it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back . add an ada wrap belt and perfection !"
__label__1 "this is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer . great paired with jeans or white denim . runs large and is a true tunic length . very pretty fabric and built in camisole too . only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new ."
__label__1 "the color heft style & quality are perfect . i did go down one size since my usual size was too large in the waist ."
__label__-1 "this top is very cute and if you are short you will love it . i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird . it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top . had to go back ."
__label__0 "i did n't have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers but this dress is incredibly long and large especially compared to the picture . for reference i 'm usually a 4/6 in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me particularly on the bottom half . i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online !"
__label__1 "i gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it ! i get many compliments on this top ! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls : )"
__label__-1 "this is a beautiful skirt but runs very small . i usually wear a size 8 and could not get the side zipper closed .... at all ."
