-1,I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors  really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t,Blouses
-1,I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it  according to the directions on the tag  it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight  and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store  but in any case  i cannot wear it again.,Blouses
-1,I bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week  but it's cut way too large that i felt like a football player. this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame. also  the cut is way too big. i was swimming in this.,Blouses
-1,I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail  and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey  but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer  so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms  small on body. odd fit.,Blouses
-1,"I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large  which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning  but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3""  weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly  it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money",Blouses
-1,Really cute piece  but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.,Blouses
-1,Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.,Blouses
-1,This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down  because of the eyelet and the cute hem  it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.,Blouses
-1,Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style  but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width  and with the peplum style  extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely  it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top  then this is perfect  but if you wanted something that hangs nicely  look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s  my typical size.,Blouses
0,"This is a beautiful blouse but needs to be returned for size. i have lost a bit of weight; the last couple of blouses i have gotten in a m (including this one) have been to large for me. i am 5'5"" tall  138 lbs and in this blouse need a s. the fabric is satiny and substantial with a gorgeous lining edged in contrasting thread.  it hits at the top of my thigh in a regular size 8 but i should have ordered a 6. i would say to size down if you are close to being between sizes. the colors are as show",Blouses
0,This top is beautiful aesthetically  and i liked the tunic length. the bottom lace is cut out  so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings. the fit is flattering.  however  i had some issues with the sizing. i usually wear an xs or a s in tops. the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me  which is seen on the model.. i tried the top with a belt  which looked nice. however  the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area. the s,Blouses
0,Nice color and great work but runs little large.,Blouses
0,"This top is so pretty in the photos  but it just did not work out for me. it is more of a pale pink color than off-white like in the photo and it just hung on me weird. i felt like it was true to size  but made me feel very boxy. i can say it was very well made  so maybe i'm just not the right body type for it. for reference  i'm 5'5"" and 135lbs. the small fit perfectly  but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste. i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect  but i'll sa",Blouses
0,While this top has a lovely design  neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me. i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads.,Blouses
0,I saw this top online and had to buy it immediate (which is rare for me). it looked loose and forgiving but had a polished look. it didn't disappoint when i tried it on. however  the straps are a bit loose and will need to be altered. the linen fabric can be rough or itchy  but still a gorgeous top!,Blouses
0,"I loved this blouse  but had to return. i am 5'2""  127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy  which is fine  but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material  it was thin but perfect for a summer nights.",Blouses
0,There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.,Blouses
0,This shirt is nice in theory but you need to have pretty long arms to make it work. you also need to be average to tall in height.,Blouses
1,I purchased this top in an antro store last week. the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique. the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders  but can be removed by snaps. i tooks great when worn two different ways. i wore it with the campole out  and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom. it also looks great when the camisole is worn in. my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli,Blouses
1,This is a really pretty print on a decent top. the only reason i returned is because it didn't look good with my skin tone and the fabric is thin. i'd planned to use it as a later under cardigans.,Blouses
1,Love this top! i'm 5' 118 lbs  purchased in a medium and plan on wearing it as a dress! it is so cute!,Blouses
1,Love this top! the colors are so fun and happy  and the fabric/fit are soft and breezy. it is definitely on the boxy side  but not in an unflattering way (in my opinion). super cute in my usual size small.,Blouses
1,"Effortless and super cute! i'm currently wearing my blue tunic for the first time with black leggings and booties - i absolutely love the everyday comfort of this piece! a few have mentioned length as being an issue - i'm wearing a regular s (my normal size) at 5'7"" and find the length similar to the model's. the cut on this is perfect - i was worried that it would look like a plaid sack on  but it's a slim cut that looks polished without needing to be belted. this will surely be a go-to for me",Blouses
1,Love this henely  the lace-up is cute. the shirt is comfy. so versatile. beach coverup or over jeans,Blouses
1,I bought the blue & white one and it is so very comfortable! it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings! great quality at a good price.,Blouses
1,This is a very pretty blouse. the fabric is lightweight and very soft. i read the other reviews and this does run very small  i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely.,Blouses
1,This top is absolutely adorable  i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring  this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this  get it! you won't regret it.,Blouses
-1,I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really  truly adorable. unfortunately  the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b  ladies  so be warned!) at the same time  the arm holes were huge  i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise  you'll for sure nee,Dresses
-1,I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back.,Dresses
-1,I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.,Dresses
-1,This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite  short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.,Dresses
-1,I really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment  especially at this price point. the fit was weird: tight in some places  too loose in others (i'm usually xs or s  i ordered this one is s). it's made out of a fairly thick and warm material  yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures  especially in the back  making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck  upper b,Dresses
-1,The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering  the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail,Dresses
-1,"I bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge. at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case. the fit is definitely ""sack-like"" as other reviewers mentioned. i had to return.",Dresses
-1,I really wanted this dress to be perfect  but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me  perhaps it works better on a taller frame.,Dresses
-1,I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too  to see if they wanted it or liked it better  but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses i just don't think is cut well.,Dresses
0,It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.,Dresses
0,The print and style we're great! unfortunately  my bust unbuttons the top. there's no way i can wear this  even if i sized up.,Dresses
0,Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival  i was on the fence. . the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large (perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body). the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms; every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth; otherwise  when the arms are extended  the sleeves do hav,Dresses
0,"I wanted to love this dress so much  but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer  and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a ""swing"" dress and is very wide  much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite)  and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture  but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey.",Dresses
0,"I just think this dress is so cute! i love it with booties!   here are the fit details: i'm 5'4 1/2"" and the front of the dress hits just above my knees. (i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo). the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button  however the button is very low. therefore  the sleeve rolls up not mid arm  but actually about three inches above my wrist!

0,This is such beautiful material  but the sleeves at the shoulders are terrible -- the gathered material makes it look like i'm wearing shoulder pads. that structured element compared to the rest of the dress (relatively unstructured) just looks ridiculous. i was so looking forward to this dress  and now it's going back.,Dresses
0,"I love the look of this dress & had high hopes  but it didn't live up to them. have no doubt that it is well made & beautiful  fully lined with lovely detailing around the neck. i am 5'6""  155lbs with a postpartum belly that i'd like to hide  so i chose this dress as the reviews say it's a bit loose & forgiving. i found it to be so loose that it looks big & entirely hides my figure! i considered ordering a small  but knew that it was simply the cut of the dress & going down a size wouldn't chang",Dresses
0,This dress looks cute in the picture and i was hopeful since it was actually silk. i'm tired of paying close to $200 for dresses that are polyester or viscose. that being said  this dress simply had too much going on. the fabrics aren't only mixed  but there is also a faint underlying pattern on the fabric that is the same shade of the main color of fabric. it was simply too much and the black lace trim made it look kind of cheap. my real issue is that although the dress itself ran big  the uppe,Dresses
0,This dress was very cute the first time i wore it  but after my second wear  the bottom layer didn't remain adjacent to the top layer and i found it to be awkward.,Dresses
1,How could this not be flattering to every figure? bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections (i know  i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now). this  paired with a darker color (and not black  yay!) makes for a perfect combination in a dress. i love that this is a deep purple  it is a dark color which is slimming  but in addition it has more appeal being colored. and it is so versatile! wear it along or with a cardigan/jacket on top. heels or boo,Dresses
1,I liked the way the dress looked in the front  but the material in the back was knit and very clingy. i did not think it was flattering on me.,Dresses
1,"I expected this dress to be pretty  but was happily surprised at the level of beautiful detail. it's hard to tell in the pictures  but the dress has a black background with tan embroidery all over  and white embroidered eyelets. the full lining is bright blue and it peeks through the eyelets  with the slit on the back and the inside of the neckline lined in bright orange. the slit on the back has two buttons closing it - a really cute detail. it fit me comfortably (i am 5'7"" and 130 - got the si",Dresses

1,I love this dress! tried it on at the store. they only had medium. while i'm usually always a medium  it fit perfectly but pulled at the bust (i'm a 38). i ordered a large online the next day. i have it now and i am extremely pleased. the pattern is unique  the length falls just above the knee and has s sexy flirtiness to it. the back button is key as it gives some contour to the dress. the side pockets are an awesome touch. you can wear this dress any season. i'm wearing it with ankle boots and,Dresses
1,The linen makes it a big wrinkly mess. i tried it on and just the act of trying it on  made it so wrinkly. i would have bought it in a second had it not been for that. love the mango color..i am in-between a 2-4 and went with the 2. i'm 5'3 and the length was a few inches above my knee...there is also a separate slip attached.  bummer.. maybe this won't bug some people but it would drive me mad. :-),Dresses
1,The issues the other reviewers mentioned didn't bother me as i don't have the prior years version to compare. i love the color and feel of the fabric.  a little heavier and great for early fall layering. the armholes weren't big for me but i got a small and would normally be a medium. the cut works great for a very curvy petite frame. it doesn't add bulk but does flatter a larger chest. i can see why this doesn't work for taller ladies as the pockets and hip do flare with the heavier fabric but,Dresses

-1,I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.,Fine gauge

0,This is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i couldn't for a few reasons i thought i'd share: the color is bright orange. it is not softer like peach in the picture. it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear. i thought'd be more swingy but it was more structured. very pretty and good quality tho.,Fine gauge
0,Dang  i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish  a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.,Fine gauge
0,Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap  like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.,Fine gauge

0,This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad  but unexpected. i am very short -waisted  and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished  and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.,Fine gauge

1,Very soft  first thing i have to say  but runs a little big  especially in the sleeves  i ordered the xxs p and the sleeves still bunch a lot at the wrists. also  other bummer is how sheer the ivory fabric is  i wish it had more substance for the price. but  i like the style and color combo. classic look  effortless  and can be paired with so many things. the regular size neckline was too low for me. the length on the petite was fine  not too short. so i say it runs big.    for reference  i am 1,Fine gauge
1,Love the color. love the design. at the hem this top runs wide. i'm still deciding whether to keep this as i think the wide hem may be somewhat flattering on me.,Fine gauge
1,I read the reviews before i bought this sweater online. one person did mention that the side slits were cut very high  but i had no idea! when i tried the xs on at home i was quite surprised by just how high up those side slits were. with just a pair of jeans  you could see flesh! at first i thought it maybe wouldn't work  but i decided to keep it because everything else about the sweater is lovely. i'll be layering this with a tank underneath. it's a bit quirky and funky and that appeals to me!,Fine gauge
1,I love this sweater!!! i checked runs large  but it's really just a roomy sweater. i bought the small  which is what i usually buy  but it is big enough to wear over long sleeve shirts  etc. it's soft and cozy and i think i wore it 3 days straight when i first got it - one of those pieces that you will wear over and over. wore it with jeans and a blouse  then with palazzos and a tee and then over my workout wear the next day before deciding it was time to give it a rest! love this sweater!!,Fine gauge
1,This sweater is really beautiful! i love this brand and this piece is one of their best yet! the fringe is perfect and flowy  a sweater that you can team with jeans and boots and be the best dressed in the room. tts  soft with no itch  really happy i bought it  and because of the color and weight this is an all year sweater which i love  because i know i will not want to pack it away. it fits just like the photo.,Fine gauge

1,I love the sparkled fabric and intricate design on the back. i had trouble with the front because the cowl exposed a bit too much  so i wore a tank top underneath. ordering a petite may have helped with the cowl.,Fine gauge
1,This is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater. the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw. but it is lightweight and delicate. i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly. i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness  i had to say no. i will watch for sale.,Fine gauge
-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates

-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,Intimates

1,This is the perfect bralette for comfort; it's soft and fits to form really quickly. i wear a b cup  and it's enough support for me to wear daily doing everything other than heavy exercise. now  at 5 months pregnant it's pretty much perfect to sleep in too. i'm at 35 band  and i'm still wearing it on the loosest closure  but it fits perfectly there for me.,Intimates

1,I've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra  could be a little more supportive. pretty color  with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.),Intimates

-1,While this is cozy and well made  the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho  which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material  the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately  the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand)  viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide)  disrupts the effortless  fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was,Jackets

0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering

0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.,Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

1,I love these tanks. the straps are wide enough to hide my bra straps. they're soft. and long enough to give me added length to shirts that run short. because this tank runs small and i had to size up to get the fit that i like  the straps are a little long  but after i alter them with a little sewing  they're perfect. i've had to do this with retailer tanks in the past  and it's worth it to me for the quality that i'm getting. the regular price is too high  so i only buy them on sale. i try,Layering

1,"This top is a great  versatile long sleeved shirt. i'm 5'10"" and the sleeves were long for me  so i don't know why it's listed as 3/4 length. i could see where sleeve length would be a problem for more petite ladies. the wine color is beautiful. it is slightly more fitted than the picture  i was afraid it might be semi-sheer  but its totally fine. i wish it was a bit longer in the torso  but it's not short like some sweaters this season. i do tend to have a shorter torso  so a tall lady with a l",Layering
1,There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect  the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening  and the cut (length  wide straps  and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure  skin color  and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...,Layering
1,I love this shirt! it was a great price and very high quality. it has different material stitched in the inside,Layering
1,I was not expecting the material to be as thick as it is. it has a wonderful drape and hand to it. i love the string tie straps so i can adjust it to fall on my chest a little higher. it seems that everything is too low-cut for my modest taste  but the ties let you decide how much cleavage to show. finding the right bra is always a little bit of a challenge with a cami  but i usually wear them under sweaters and jackets  so i'm not terribly concerned.,Layering
1,I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray. this top did not disappoint. it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing. the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying. i am not big busted so i didn't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have.,Layering

0,I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still,Legwear

0,"I received these as a christmas gift. they are really cozy: warm  soft and super comfortable. however  they stretch out a lot  as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band. this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up. this is fine for hanging out around the house  but not if you want to wear them out and about. i'm keeping them because they're so comfortable  but beware how much they stretch.

1,I couldn't believe the bargain price of these leggings  so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors. when they arrived  i was equally pleased to see how soft  cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different. the black has a vertical lined texture  the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!,Legwear

-1,Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.  i ordered these in the green and they arrived today. they fit me as if they were an xxl. i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same.   obviously they are going back tomorrow . i'm very disappointed  they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty.,Pants
-1,I really wanted to love this  but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits  and the medium was billowing around me. also the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.,Pants
-1,I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug. you need a big chest and small legs and bottom. too bad. it's very cute.,Pants
-1,I'm petite  but even if i weren't  i think this runs very large  isn't form flattering at all  and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.,Pants
0,Ok  if i had a different body  this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband couldn't tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage)  it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me  this isn't the jumpsuit for you.     this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area (hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters).     for reference  i am 5'3 and 150 pounds. th,Pants
0,I love the fit of these pants. i bought them in several colors  but unfortunately when i laundered the teal blue pair  the places where the liquid detergent touched them (not bleach  detergent) look like they've touched bleach. i washed them in cold with regular detergent but will be unable to wear them after one wear. i was confused and even checked the detergent to make sure it did not have bleach in it  and it does not. very disappointing and i hope this is not true of the dye in the other co,Pants
0,I so wanted to love this jumpsuit but unfortunately the fit is so off. it runs small and the crotch is to high. the color is beautiful and the design is great. it's really sad i waited two months for this and it was definitely not worth the wait.,Pants
0,I ordered a large  and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed. for me  it was not. it ran a little small on top  buttons bulged at my chest  and was hard to put on. bottom part fit well (although flattened my butt unflatteringly). i'm sure this works for some  just wasn't the right fit for me. sent it back.,Pants
0,I purchased these pants in blue  they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer.,Pants
0,I wish these zipped up instead of the drawstring. they are super cute but don't care for the way they sit on the hips.,Pants
0,These are beautiful pants  especially when you walk  they are simply beautiful and flow nicely. however  they are soooo very long (i am 5 5 1/2) and even with a big wedge's i would have to get these altered. the waist seemed very small  i am a sz 12 (10 in some stores) and i got the large and it was way too tight in the waist and have no stretch or give at all. . probably a sz 10 at most. so unfortunetly they have to go back.,Pants
0,These pants are cute. they seem  to me  to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big  so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down  but unfortunately  look pretty sloppy by the end of the day  as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big  this is a major negative. i wore them to church  and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon  they looked like a different pair of pants.,Pants
0,I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.,Pants
1,"I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist  but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging  but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch  but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference  i am 5'4""  34/26/38  and i got a 6 regular.",Pants

1,"These culottes are fun. i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs. in my opinion  they run big. i am usually a small (4-6)  31"" waist  38"" hips. pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend  but with a longer tank or shirt  they looked fine. the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down. so far  wrinkling isn't a huge problem but we'll see. i am 5' 9"" tall and these fall about the same place on the model--mid calf. they looked grea",Pants
1,I have been searching for these pants my whole life. i have them in several colors. i wear the moss most often. i'd recommend your normal size or size down if in between sizes. they stretch a bit as you wear them. one other thing- after being washed and dried the color has lightened significantly.,Pants
1,Probably should have noticed the material this jumpsuit is made of before buying. tencel  thus little to no give kind of like linen and silk. beautiful material  soft with a slight sheen. the top portion fits well and the triangles cover the girls well (36dd). unfortunately there is no give on the back end for my bottom which is quite round and its tight around my thighs which aren't small either. (l/xl and 14). and sadly an xl would be too big upstairs and baggy around the middle. sigh  oh well,Pants
1,My favorite pants  casual and a bit dressier by changing my top. comfortable  classic  well made,Pants
1,I've been looking for comfortable pants for the summer.  this pants is the answer.  it's comfortable  thin  and yet not to sheer.  this pants a bit loose  i could fit in s.  i usually buy size 8 or 10 for shorts from retailer  so i'll say this pants run big.  the con with this pants is the stitching around the back pockets is not very sturdy.  i found tiny holes on 2 other pairs before i bought mine.,Pants
1,Super cute  well made  great embroidery. waist runs big.,Pants
1,These pants are so flattering  comfortable  and silky smooth. a versatile fall staple for sure. i bought my usual 28 and they fit perfectly.,Pants
-1,The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.,Shorts
-1,Beware. white is not white. white is more cream  off-white  light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute  but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also  the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.,Shorts
-1,I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy  but after laundering one time  the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors  but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback  but be careful with laundering.,Shorts
-1,I was excited to get this romper  but it just didn't work. i'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me. returned.,Shorts
-1,I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.,Shorts
-1,These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!,Shorts
-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,Shorts

0,I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper  etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.,Shorts
0,Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,Shorts
0,I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt,Shorts
0,I wanted to like this romper  it is very cute and colorful  but to top was overywhelming for my size and made me look even shorter.,Shorts
0,"The shorts are very cute  very nice quality and intricate detailing! the sizing is tight in waist and very big in legs not flattering at all. i'm 5'1""  115 lbs. they are going back.",Shorts
0,I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing  but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however  they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5'  i typically buy size 0 or xs  but these looked a bit ridiculous on me  with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash  since they're 100% cotton  and that helped some  along with getting rid of the creases from shipping,Shorts
0,"I'm 5'4""  130 lbs  curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on  they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite  curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area.",Shorts
0,I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy  untreatable stains). unfortunately  the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back,Shorts

1,"The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand.  .  i tried a size 2 and it fit fine  just above my long waist ( 5'2""  currently 33-25-37.5 with narrow hips and fuller thighs). i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes 0 and 2  depending on my weight  and these fit similarly. i think the size 2 petite would be a bit lower but it's sold out now.  .  the only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s",Shorts
1,Lovely! feels like you are wearing silk and hits for comfort in all the right places. still mulling whether the short length is appropriate and if my athletic/full lower body is complimented by this cutie...needed a second opinion to push me over the top and take this home as a summer staple,Shorts
1,I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit. i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look.,Shorts
1,I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve,Shorts

1,The fabric design of these shorts is so great. i don't adore the fit  they are a little short waisted for my long torso and the leg openings flare out more than i prefer and are about 1/2-1 inch longer than i would like but i can fix the inseam issue by hemming them. i may still pick them up just because i love the fabric so much.,Shorts

0,I don't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do. it fits a little bit weird on me  and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit (the knot is not adjustable). the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs  so i can't size down. the knit is substantial  so that's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just wasn't flattering on me. i had recently bought and loved lilke's tideline pencil skirt  which also has a fabric tie wrap,Skirts
